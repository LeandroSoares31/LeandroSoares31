## Hi there!ðŸ‘‹ How's it going?

# Welcome to my GitHub Profile!

Here I will share with you a little bit about my life.

Well, my name is Leandro and I live in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. I love play football on weekends and I apreciate Hip Hop musics.

I am graduated in Mechanical Engineering and post graduated in Quality Engineering and Production Engineering with Project Management.

This year in August I participated a Hackathon organized by Recode and I got to pass the selection process to take a Full Stack developer course. Today my focus on studies is totally in software development because I intend to work as Full Stack developer.

- ðŸŒ± Currently learning: HTML, CSS/Bootstrap, JavaScript and PHP.
